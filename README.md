# Regionize

A 4k library to flow HTML through multiple regions,
like the ill-fated CSS Regions. The user is responsible
for providing the next element when content
overflows.

Assumptions:
- Provided elements are already in the document.
- Provided elements have an intrinsic height before content is added.
